The project is done in google collab, so to run the codes successfully, you will need to download the ipynb file and upload to google collab, then run from cell 3, ONE BY ONE, and then restart the whole kernel. Make sure this dataset
is stored in your google drive because collab cant process the h5ad file directly.
